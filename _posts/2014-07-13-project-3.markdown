description: This website was designed during a summer internship for Rampant Software LLC, which is a software development startup located in portland OR. The website will eventually be utilized as the Rampant Software company website once completed. Currently the website is very close to completion and will be available for viewing once the graphic designer is done adding their work to the website. Once the site is available for viewing I will be adding a link below in order to showcase my work. Development of the website was done using the static site development software called Jekyll.
