description: Tracmow.com is a front-end website designed to showcase the TracMow Robot for BCS America, located in Portland Oregon. The TracMow Robot is a remote controlled robot designed to mow large areas from a distance, one example of the many uses for this robot is mowing in between crops. This website was created using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, it was designed in order to showcase the robot. In the future I will be reworking the entire website in to a full stack website, the features I will be adding include a video hosting page and a dealer located. Please visit tracmow.com if you would like to view my work.
