description: TagYoureIt is a full stack application that I am currently working on for Rampant Software LLC. This application will be designed to allow users to play a game of tag from their mobile devices. Users will eventually be capable of downloading the application on their phones, creating a user account, having a friends list, and the ability to tag their friends when within a certain range of one another. User accounts can be created both within the application and through the use of OAuth2 to connect to either their Facebook or Google account. This application is a work in progress and will be explained in further detail as development progresses. If you would like more information on this project please feel free to contact me by filling out the contact form at the bottom of this website.
