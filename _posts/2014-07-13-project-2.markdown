description: LunchMoney is a full stack application I began working on as a personal project in January of 2019. This application is constructed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS). The purpose of this project is to supply small restaurants with an application for inventory management. I was inspired to make this application after watching the television series Kitchen Nightmares. One pattern that I regularly saw in failing small restaurants was a lack of inventory management which often led to expired/rotten food, poor profit margins, or food pricing that was absurdly high. My solution was an open source application that could handle simple inventory management without forcing small restaurants to spend thousands on a fancy program they don't need. This application is still under development, feel free to take a look at my code linked below if you are interested.
