description: Lawn-robot.com is a front-end website designed to showcase the Ambrogio Robot for BCS America, located in Portland Oregon. The Ambrogio Robot is an automated robot designed to mow your lawn for you, the robot functions similar to a Roomba vacuum. This website was created using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, it was designed in order to showcase the robot. In the future I will be reworking the entire website in to a full stack website, the features I will be adding include online purchases and a dealer located. Please visit lawn-robot.com if you would like to view my work.
