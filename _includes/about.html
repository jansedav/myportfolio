                    I am a senior at Oregon State University pursuing a bachelor’s degree in computer science with a minor in business. Currently I am working as a level 2 Student Support Technician for the College of Business at Oregon State University and will be graduating in the Spring of 2019. I have also recently started working as an Academic Tech Assistant for Oregon State University. During my Sophomore year of college, I attended my first website development class where I instantly fell in love with web development. Since then I have furthered my passion for web development through an internship, free-lance web development, and personal projects of my own. Currently I am working on multiple different projects, which are outlined in the “Work in Progress” tabs under the portfolio section above.  These projects include full stack website development, front-end website development, and process containerization. As I continue working on new projects and expanding my portfolio new additions will be made to this website.

                    Outside of school, and the workplace, I enjoy spending most of my time with family and friends. I was raised on a small farm and have always enjoyed the outdoors, hiking, camping and fishing. When I was young, I raised sheep and competed annually with my 4H club both for show and market. Staying active is also an important aspect of my life and I love playing basketball, working out at the gym, and snowboarding.

                    My passion for technology started when I was in high school and took my first computer science class. Upon entering college, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do and entered the college of business at Oregon State. When I got in to my sophomore year, I was unhappy with my choice and remembered how much I enjoyed the computer science class I took in high school, this drove me to make the switch. I started working towards my degree in computer science during the end of my sophomore year of college and found myself thoroughly enjoying it, I knew I had made the right choice. Eventually I began working as a Student Support Technician for the college of business, this job has only furthered my love for technology.
